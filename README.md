# Recommender-Systems
This Recommender system was developed as part of course (STAT 542) requirement in R. We used R Shiny, CSS and HTML for developing and deploying this application. The dataset was provided to us by the professor. Two recommendation algortihms (Collaborative filters), namely IBCF and UBCF were tried and implemented.
